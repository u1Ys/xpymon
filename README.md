# SYNOPSIS

xpywm

# DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents **xpymon**, a minimal but versatile system monitor
on Linux.  **xpymon** is designed to work with **xpywm**, a simple but
extensible X11 window manager written in Python
(https://pypi.org/project/xpywm/).  However, **xpymon** can be used
independently and be combined with other window managers.

**xpymon** consumes the minimum amount of the desktop; i.e., the height of the
statsu monitor window is just eight pixels.

# ~OPTIONS~

- -T

  Run in test mode.

# REQUIREMENTS

The implementation of **xpymon** heavily depends on the Linux kernel (/proc
and /sys pseudo filesystems) and its standard utilities such as ip (iproute2),
ifconfig (net-tools), and iwconfig (wireless-tools).

# ~INSTALLATION~

```sh
$ sudo apt install iproute2 net-tools wireless-tools 
$ pip3 install xpymon
```

# ~AVAILABILITY~

The latest version of **xpymon** is available at PyPI
(https://pypi.org/project/xpymon/) .
